My Final Year Project code repository


For my Final Year Project, I am doing a parking management system that uses Arduino and web system using PHP and MySQL. The main idea of this project is that it uses RFID as the parking ticket where there is two different type of users, normal users and monthly ticket users. Both of this users uses RFID ticket. The RFID UID is communicating with MySQL database using Processing 3 which was programmed using Java language. The web system mainly uses to manage and monitor the parking system. Upon payment, the users can see their parking location. This can solve the problem of forgetting where the users parked their car and thus will reduce the time to search for their vehicles.
